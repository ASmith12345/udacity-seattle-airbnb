Analysis of Seattle airbnb data for Udacity Data Science NanoDegree Course

# Libraries
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, datetime and calendar.

# Motivation
I was interested in the following questions:
What is the most popular location to host?
What is the most popular month to host?
Is weekly price or reviews a better predictor of whether a property is booked?
What features are the best predictor of this feature?

# File description
The files included are reviews.csv, calendar.csv and ReadMe. The alaysis was done in a notebook called seattle-airbnb-analysis.

# Summary of analysis
I found that the Neighbourhood which would lead to most bookings was Capitol Hill. The most popular monht to book was in January. Reviews better predicted whether a property was booked than price. A property would get the best review if it was considered good value for money. 

A deeper dive into the analysis can be found here.
